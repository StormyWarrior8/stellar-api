# Stellar API
**A bookmark organizer for Github Stars.** You can manage and tag your Github stars using this tool. Built on Node, Restify, Passport, and Mongoose.

### Dependencies
Most of the dependencies are listed in the package.json file and are installed via
```
npm install
```
I personally use nodemon for development, and passenger for deployment.

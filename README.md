# Stellar API
**A bookmark organizer for Github Stars.** You can manage and tag your Github stars using this tool. Built on Node, Restify, Passport, and Mongoose.

### Application Layers
This repo is for the server-side API layer of Stellar. You can use this with whatever front-end you choose. I am also building an "official" front-end for the domain, [found here](http://github.com/therebelrobot/stellar-client). Feel free to check it out and contribute as desired.

### Dependencies
Most of the dependencies are listed in the package.json file and are installed via
```
npm install
```
I personally use nodemon for development, and passenger for deployment.
